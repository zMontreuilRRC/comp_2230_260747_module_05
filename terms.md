# Important Terms
## Application Programming Interface (API)
- *Interface*: a means of providing input/output
  - For example, *GUI (Graphical User Interface*, your desktop), *CLI (Command Line Interface)*
- APIs are methods or classes that can be used to interact with different set of data or sources -- for example, Python's File API (read, write, etc.) or JavaScript's DOM (a means of interacting with a website)
- *Third-Party APIs* are means of interacting with external sources of data.

## RESTful APIs
REST refers to *Representational State Transfer*, which is a design pattern for transferring data. We use HTTP requests like GET and receive JSON data.

REST is the currently dominant form of data transfer between web apps.

Another commonly used web API is SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) which uses XML.
